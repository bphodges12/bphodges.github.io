            { name: "Terrain & Slope Severity", description: "Steep slopes can challenge a robotic mower’s traction and efficiency, even though models exist for extreme slopes. These specialized units work best in specific areas rather than across an entire course. Improving traction and advancing more efficient AWD technology will be a key focus across brands in the coming years.", minLabel: "Steep", maxLabel: "Flat" },
            { name: "Power Infrastructure", description: "Self-docking robotic mowers depend on well-placed charging stations. These machines aren’t setting land-speed records, so efficiency drops if they have to travel long distances to recharge. Many courses splice power from irrigation controllers to adopt on course. Poor electrical coverage? Take advantage of existing outlets in pro shops, maintenance buildings, halfway houses, or range huts for initial robot placement.", minLabel: "Localized Power", maxLabel: "Widespread Access" },
            { name: "Connectivity & Cellular Coverage", description: "Strong cellular coverage allows mowers to communicate effectively with their control systems. Workarounds exist for weak or non-existent signal areas, but they typically require additional infrastructure like cellular hotspots, boosters, or mesh WiFi networks.", minLabel: "Poor Coverage", maxLabel: "Strong Signal" },
            { name: "Tree Coverage & Obstacles", description: "Dense tree cover and physical obstructions (buildings, cart barns, etc.) can disrupt RTK signal reception and create inefficiencies. Constant debris from trees can also make robotic mowing unsustainable in certain areas.", minLabel: "Dense Cover", maxLabel: "Open & Clear" },
            { name: "Course Layout & Mowing Zones", description: "A well-connected course allows for efficient mowing with minimal travel time between zones. If your holes and mowing areas are spread out like islands, expect additional logistical challenges or the need for more units.", minLabel: "Separated & Disconnected", maxLabel: "Connected & Efficient" },
            { name: "Play & Traffic Considerations", description: "The ability to run autonomous mowers depends on when and how often you can mow. High player traffic and frequent events can limit operating hours, whereas certain courses allow for nearly round-the-clock mowing.", minLabel: "Heavy Restrictions", maxLabel: "Open Schedule" },
            { name: "Drainage & Surface Conditions", description: "Poorly draining areas or uneven surfaces can lead to mowers getting stuck and needing human intervention. Identifying problem areas ahead of time can help prevent downtime. Driving ranges are often the worst offenders in this category.", minLabel: "Difficult Terrain", maxLabel: "Easy Going" },
            { name: "Boundary Management & Hazards", description: "The more complex your course’s mowing zones, no-go areas, and obstacles (stakes, benches, signage, etc.), the more initial setup and ongoing monitoring your robots will require.", minLabel: "High Complexity", maxLabel: "Free & Clear" },
            { name: "Security & Vandalism Risk", description: "Public courses and high-traffic areas are more vulnerable to theft or vandalism. Secure storage solutions and strategic operating hours can help mitigate risk at the cost of efficiency. Some robots with \"drop and go\" technology are better suited for these situations.", minLabel: "High Risk", maxLabel: "Low Risk" },
            { name: "Maintenance & Service Model", description: "Some superintendents will need a full-service support model to maintain this new technology, while others will want to develop in-house expertise for repairs and troubleshooting. Full-service options will improve over time, but early adopters with a willingness for hands-on knowledge will have an easier transition as well as being well prepared for the future.", minLabel: "Needs Full-Service", maxLabel: "In-House Expert" }
